1. it will print out the lenght of the array to the console, which in this case is 3.
2. it will print out the intial discounted price of the last item in the array to the console, which in this case is 150.
3. it will print out the final discounted price of the last item in the array to the console, which in this case is 150.
4. The function will return an array of the discounted prices of the original prices, rounded to the nearest whoe number.
5. There will be an error because i is only defined in the scope of the for loop because of the keyword let.
6. There will be an error because discountedPrice is only defined in the scope of the for loop because of the keyword let.
7. It will return 150 because FinalPrice is defined the scope of the function.
8. The function will return an array with the discounted prices of the original array.
9. There will be an error because i is only defined in the for loop.
10. It will return the length of the array, which was set at the beginning of the function.
11. It'll return an array of the discounted prices from the original array.
12. A) student.name
    B) student['Grad Year']

    C) 3  null is treated as zero
    D) 3null null is treated as as string with the word null
    E) 4 true is considered as 1
    F) 0 False and null is considered as 0
    G) 3undefined undefined is treated as a string containing the word undefined
    H) NaN character '3' is treated as a number    
14. A) true '2' is treated as the number 2
    B) false '2' is greater in lexicological order than '1'
    C) true comparison with type conversion
    D) false comparison without type conversion
    E) false true is converted to number 1
    F) true 2 converted to bool is true
15. == compares equality with type compariosn while === compares equality with no type conversions
17. We run the for loop the same amount of times as the length of the array, in this case 3. With each iteration, we apply the function 
    DoSomething to each value in the array. The values after running through the function DoSomething is 2,4,6. These values are pushed onto newArr and     
    function modifyArray returns the array. So function modifyArray returns [2,4,6]
